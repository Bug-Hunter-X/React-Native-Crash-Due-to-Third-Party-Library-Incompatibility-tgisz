This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not compatible with the current version of React Native or has bugs in its implementation. For instance, using an outdated library that uses deprecated APIs can lead to unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior.  Another example involves libraries that have conflicting dependencies, resulting in runtime errors.  A specific instance might be a library that attempts to access a feature not supported on a particular platform (iOS vs Android).
