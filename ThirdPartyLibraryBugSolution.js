The solution depends on the nature of the incompatibility. First, identify the problematic library using the error messages from the crash report or by systematically commenting out library imports.  If an update is available, update the library using npm or yarn. If the problem persists, consider:

1. **Switching to an alternative library:** Find a well-maintained replacement that provides similar functionality.
2. **Fixing the library directly (if possible and you have the skills):** Examine the library's source code to identify and resolve the issue. Contribute your fix back to the community by submitting a pull request.
3. **Debugging the specific incompatibility:** Carefully examine the error messages and identify the root cause of the conflict. This might involve adjusting library configurations or modifying your app's code to work around the limitation.

Example (Illustrative):  Let's assume the buggy library is 'react-native-incompatible-lib'.

**Before (buggy):**
```javascript
import IncompatibleLib from 'react-native-incompatible-lib';

// ... code that uses IncompatibleLib ...
```

**After (solution):**
```javascript
import CompatibleLib from 'react-native-compatible-lib'; // Replacement library

// ... code that uses CompatibleLib ...
```
